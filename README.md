# iris-flower-classification

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
- Source: Built-in Iris dataset from `scikit-learn`
- Features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Libraries Required
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iris-flower-classification.git
    cd iris-flower-classification
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook iris_model.ipynb
    ```

## Results
- Achieved over **95% accuracy** using Random Forest Classifier.
- Visualizations and feature importance included for model interpretation.
